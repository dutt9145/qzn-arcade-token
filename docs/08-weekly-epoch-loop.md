# Weekly Epoch Loop

The arcade ecosystem operates on a transparent weekly epoch cycle.

Each epoch reports:
- Total QZN burned
- Events and tournaments funded
- Creators and builders rewarded
- Games and features launched

Vault-based accounting separates burn activity, event funding, builder rewards, and liquidity support to ensure clarity and transparency.
