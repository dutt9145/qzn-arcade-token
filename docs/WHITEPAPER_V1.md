# QZN Whitepaper v1  
## The Decentralized Arcade Layer of Qubic

---

# Abstract

QZN is the native coordination and creation unit of the decentralized arcade layer built on the Qubic network.

It is not designed to represent ownership, governance, yield, or financial claims.  
QZN exists to instantiate arcades, deploy games, bind programmable economies, and coordinate players, builders, and arcade systems into persistent digital environments.

QZN is the material from which arcades are born.

# 1. The Arcade Layer

The Arcade Layer is a protocol layer built on Qubic that enables anyone to create, expand, and operate decentralized arcade environments.

Arcades are not websites.

They are persistent on-chain systems composed of:

- Games  
- Tournament engines  
- Reward logic  
- Builder permissions  
- Player progression  
- Asset systems  
- Event infrastructure  
- Historical records  

Each arcade becomes a digital territory with its own internal economy, culture, and lifecycle.

QZN is required to instantiate and operate this layer.

---

# 2. Why QZN Exists

Digital games today are cheap to create and cheap to abandon.

Servers are infinite.  
Worlds are disposable.  
Platforms inflate endlessly.

The Arcade Layer introduces a different model:

- Every expansion has cost  
- Every world is consequential  
- Every system leaves history  

QZN exists to make digital arcade creation economically irreversible.

---

# 3. Arcade Creation & Expansion

QZN is consumed to create surface area in the Arcade Layer.

Core creation actions include:

- Genesis of new arcades  
- Deployment of game worlds  
- Activation of tournament engines  
- Launch of seasonal realms  
- Instantiation of arcade infrastructure  

Arcades cannot be cloned without cost.

Every arcade leaves a permanent economic footprint.

---

# 4. Programmable Arcade Objects

The Arcade Layer introduces a new class of primitives:

## Programmable Arcade Objects (PAOs)

These are not cosmetic NFTs.

They are operational protocol components.

Examples include:

- Arcade Cabinets  
- Tournament Licenses  
- Builder Nodes  
- Event Engines  
- Reward Routers  
- Franchise Cores  
- Seasonal Realms  

PAOs can:

- Route players  
- Spawn competitions  
- Distribute rewards  
- Gate access  
- Evolve through usage  
- Degrade or expire  
- Merge or fork  

QZN is the only resource capable of instantiating, evolving, repairing, and retiring these objects.

---

# 5. Builder & Game Economies

Every serious game launched on the Arcade Layer becomes a micro-economy.

QZN is required to:

- Publish games  
- Bind reward logic  
- Enable tournaments  
- Mint arcade objects  
- Activate progression systems  
- Deploy multiplayer infrastructure  

Builders are not simply uploading content.

They are launching systems.

---

# 6. Player Progression & Cultural Layer

The Arcade Layer is designed to accumulate history.

Players build:

- Identities  
- Skill records  
- Reputations  
- Achievements  
- Cabinets  

Builders build:

- Arcades  
- Franchises  
- Competitive ecosystems  
- Seasonal worlds  

QZN enables persistence, continuity, and irreversible progression.

# 7. QZN Token Properties

- Network: Qubic  
- Fixed Supply: 676,000,000 QZN  
- Minting: Genesis mint  
- Inflation: None  
- Reissuance: None  
- Deflation: Continuous through protocol consumption  

QZN is not designed to circulate endlessly.

It is designed to be transformed into permanent protocol surface.

---

# 8. Earning QZN

QZN may be earned through verifiable contribution:

- Skill-based gameplay  
- Tournament performance  
- Game development  
- Arcade operations  
- Event orchestration  
- Builder participation  
- Ecosystem initiatives  

Anti-abuse systems may include:

- Skill-weighted rewards  
- Emission throttles  
- Epoch accounting  
- Vesting delays  
- Behavioral analysis  

---

# 9. Consumption & Deflation

QZN is primarily a consumptive token.

Primary sinks include:

- Arcade genesis events  
- Game deployment  
- Tournament engines  
- Cabinet minting  
- Franchise creation  
- Seasonal realm launches  
- Builder tooling activation  
- Prestige and progression systems  

Core creation flows permanently remove supply.

---

# 10. Locking & Permissions

Locking QZN confers protocol permissions, not financial return.

Examples include:

- Arcade operation  
- Tournament hosting  
- Builder tooling  
- Experimental modules  
- Early system access  
- Advanced arcade controls  

Locking never creates yield.

It only unlocks capability.

---

# 11. Epoch Transparency

The Arcade Layer operates in epoch cycles that publicly report:

- QZN consumed  
- Arcades created  
- Games launched  
- Objects instantiated  
- Events executed  
- Builders activated  
- Supply removed  

These metrics define the growth of the arcade civilization.

---

# 12. The Irreversible Arcade

Every major digital world in history inflated endlessly.

The Arcade Layer does not.

In this system:

- Every arcade destroys supply  
- Every expansion leaves a scar  
- Every game binds history  
- Every world has origin  

Nothing meaningful happens without cost.

This creates something the internet has never had:

**A finite, expanding, economically irreversible arcade civilization.**

# 13. Disclaimer

QZN is a digital coordination and creation token intended solely for use within decentralized arcade systems. It is not intended to represent ownership, profit rights, governance authority, or investment claims.

Nothing in this document constitutes financial advice.
