# Protocol Rent

Arcade applications deployed within the Qubic ecosystem pay protocol rent in QZN.

Protocol rent applies to actions such as:
- Game publishing
- Tournament hosting
- Marketplace activity
- NFT minting

This mechanism establishes QZN as the standard coordination unit for arcade infrastructure while ensuring ongoing participation-based demand.
