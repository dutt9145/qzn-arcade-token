# Executive Summary

QZN is a fixed-supply, non-financial arcade utility token designed for use within decentralized arcade applications built on the Qubic network.

The token exists solely to coordinate gameplay, creation, tournaments, progression, and protocol-level arcade operations. QZN is not intended to function as a governance token, investment vehicle, yield-bearing asset, or store of value.

QZN operates as a closed-loop system. Tokens are earned through verifiable contribution and consumed through irreversible arcade actions, with significant portions of usage permanently burned. This design ensures sustainability, fairness, and long-term alignment across players, creators, and infrastructure.
