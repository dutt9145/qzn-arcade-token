# Executive Summary

QZN is a fixed-supply, non-financial arcade utility token designed to function as the native operating layer for decentralized arcade applications built on Qubic. It is not a governance token, financial instrument, store of value, or yield-bearing asset.

QZN operates as a closed-loop system: it is earned through verifiable contribution (skill-based gameplay, tournaments, content creation, ecosystem services) and spent on irreversible actions (cosmetics, publishing, access permissions, protocol rent). A significant portion of spending results in permanent token burns, creating long-term supply contraction without inflation or reissuance. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
