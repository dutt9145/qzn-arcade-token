# Spending and Burn Mechanics

QZN is designed to be consumed through use.

Certain actions permanently burn QZN, removing it from circulation, while others recycle tokens into ecosystem activity.

Examples of permanent burn actions:
- Cosmetic items and visual effects
- Name changes and badges
- Game publishing and verification
- Arcade signaling actions

Examples of recycled spending:
- Tournament entry fees
- Seasonal passes
- Marketplace activity

Burn mechanics ensure long-term supply discipline and prevent accumulation without participation.
