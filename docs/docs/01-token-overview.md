# Token Overview

QZN is a non-redeemable digital utility token used exclusively within arcade applications deployed on Qubic. It enables gameplay progression, tournament participation, cosmetic customization, creation workflows, and ecosystem signaling.

QZN does not represent ownership, profit rights, treasury control, or governance authority. Governance functionality, where present, is limited to non-binding arcade signaling and discovery mechanisms. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
