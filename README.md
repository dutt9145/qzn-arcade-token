# QZN — The Decentralized Arcade Layer of Qubic

QZN is the native coordination and creation unit of the decentralized arcade layer built on the Qubic network.

QZN is not designed to represent ownership, governance, yield, or financial claims.  
It exists to instantiate arcades, deploy games, bind programmable economies, and coordinate players, builders, and arcade systems into persistent digital environments.

QZN is the material from which arcades are born.

## 🌐 What is QZN?

The QZN Arcade Layer enables anyone to create and operate decentralized arcade environments.

Arcades are not websites.

They are persistent on-chain systems composed of:

- Games  
- Tournament engines  
- Reward logic  
- Builder permissions  
- Player progression  
- Asset systems  
- Event infrastructure  
- Historical records  

Each arcade becomes a digital territory with its own internal economy, culture, and lifecycle.

QZN is required to instantiate and expand this layer.

## 🧠 Why QZN Exists

Digital games today are cheap to create and cheap to abandon.

Servers are infinite.  
Worlds are disposable.  
Platforms inflate endlessly.

The Arcade Layer introduces a different model:

- Every expansion has cost  
- Every world is consequential  
- Every system leaves history  

QZN exists to make digital arcade creation economically irreversible.

## 🏗️ Core Capabilities

QZN is consumed to:

- Create new decentralized arcades  
- Deploy games and game worlds  
- Activate tournament engines  
- Mint programmable arcade objects  
- Launch seasonal realms  
- Bind progression and reward logic  

QZN is not used to speculate.

It is used to cause permanent creation.

## 🧩 Programmable Arcade Objects

The Arcade Layer introduces a new class of on-chain primitives:

**Programmable Arcade Objects (PAOs)**

Examples include:

- Arcade Cabinets  
- Tournament Licenses  
- Builder Nodes  
- Event Engines  
- Reward Routers  
- Franchise Cores  
- Seasonal Realms  

These objects are not cosmetic NFTs.

They are operational protocol components that route players, spawn competitions, distribute rewards, and evolve over time.

QZN is the only resource capable of instantiating and evolving these objects.

## 🛠️ Builder Ecosystem

Builders do not simply upload games.

They launch systems.

QZN is required to:

- Publish games  
- Bind reward logic  
- Enable multiplayer and tournaments  
- Mint arcade infrastructure  
- Activate progression layers  

Every serious game becomes a micro-economy within the arcade layer.

## 🔥 The Irreversible Arcade

In this system:

- Every arcade destroys supply  
- Every expansion leaves a scar  
- Every game binds history  
- Every world has an origin  

Nothing meaningful happens without cost.

This creates something the internet has never had:

**A finite, expanding, economically irreversible arcade civilization.**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

QZN is a digital coordination and creation token intended solely for use within decentralized arcade systems. It is not intended to represent ownership, profit rights, governance authority, or investment claims.

Nothing in this repository constitutes financial advice.

## 🧬 Status

QZN is under active development.

The Arcade Layer is evolving.

Builders are welcome.

---

## 🤝 Community & Builders

This repository will evolve to include:

- Arcade core systems  
- Builder tooling  
- Game deployment frameworks  
- Tournament engines  
- Platform documentation

QZN is not a game.

It is the layer on which arcades are built.
